# Welcome
## Commit Explanation
I had not added this to GitHub until this commit, so a lot of the initial code was created by me, but versions are not logged in commits, because I had not created a repository until now.

## Usage
This is not intended for public use, you would like a template, to create a similar site, I can work on making that.  But for now, this is not anything but an easy way to access the code for this website

## Privacy
All work on this website is mine, I own it, it is copyrighted to me, Max Simon, including the website itself.

## Were you just on maxsimon.io
If your coming from my website, maxsimon.io, then you probably don't know what this weird page is, well then, github is a site for devs like me to post changes to my site (so you'r seeing the newest version of my code!).  


_**Thank You**_
