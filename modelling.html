    <h2 id="content_sec-title">Intro</h2>
    <p>I consider myself a very creative person, and one of my favorite ways to express myself  is with coding.  Coding allows me to design user interfaces -- the artistic and human part of technology -- and figure out how to turn them into code.  I also really like to use traditional coding and try to figure out more innovative ways to accomplish something with code.   Here I have selected a couple of examples of code I created that I consider good representatives of what I enjoy doing.</p>

    <h2 id="content_sec-title">Floating Ball</h2>
    <p>
      This might not look like much, but this is one of the best representatives of my skill.  This does not have anything to do with the ball in the center, but the textures in the background.  This is the first time I really understood how to create and render very realistic textures.  The wood on the floor is realistically textured, as if there were bumps, that there really are on a piece of wood.  The tiles on the walls also have gloss like they were actually tiles that were lit with actual light.

    <h2 id="content_sec-title">Jenga Simulation</h2>
    <p>
      This was one of the first simulations that I did that I rendered.  It shows a large orange ball crashing into a tower built up of a bunch of planks.  The cool thing about this was I did not animate each block to move in a specific way.  I programmed them to move in a realistic motion.  Physics simulations are some of my favorite things, because they take a lot of work, but end up looking the most realistic.
