      <h2 id="content_sec-title">Writing</h2>
      <p>
Ever since I was young, I have had a love for writing.  I love all types of writing, including poetry, creative writing, and even expository writing.  Writing is something I find incredibly enjoyable because it gives me an outlet to express my creativity and to explore ways of subtly changing the meaning of a statement through the use of words.  Sometimes I challenge myself to rework something I’ve written to make it shorter.  When I do this, it forces me to think about the word choices I make.   I have included it in my portfolio because I wanted to showcase a few of my favorite examples of my written work.  Adults always think of me as a “techy” person because I still have a love for very technological things, but Language Arts is my favorite class.  Enjoy.

      <h2 id="content_sec-title">Programming</h2><p>
I consider myself a very creative person, and one of my favorite ways to express myself  is with coding.  Coding allows me to design user interfaces -- the artistic and human part of technology -- and figure out how to turn them into code.  I also really like to use traditional coding and try to figure out more innovative ways to accomplish something with code.   Here I have selected a couple of examples of code I created that I consider good representatives of what I enjoy doing.

      <h2 id="content_sec-title">3D Modelling</h2>
      <p>
        3D modelling is like painting, but with a whole new dimension.  I started by finding a free modelling software on the internet, downloading it and, not knowing anything about it, opening it.  I found a cube, something called a lamp, and something titled camera.  I played around with the software and started to understand how it worked.  Three years later, I can now render incredibly realistic scenes, and create life-like animations.  I chose to “show off” three of what I consider my best work, which consists of two videos and an image render.

      <h2 id="content_sec-title">Photography</h2>
      <p>
        I have enjoyed photography ever since i was little mostly, because it's so different than any other art form.  Instead of being able to customize every bit of a painting, or any other traditional art piece for that matter, it allows me to take take my vision of something  and through the way I frame it in the lens, I can make it more beautiful or more interesting.  I believe anything can be an amazing photo  It requires skill of seeing something, and knowing how to view it as art..  Photography allows me to only be limited by my own knowledge of how to take a photo, something everybody has, and can be unleashed.
