    <p>
	Ever since I was young, was I have  had a love for writingtten arts.  I love all types of writing  -- including, like poetry, and creative writing, and even expository writing.  Writing is something I find incredibly enjoyable because it gives me an outlet to express my feelings and to has always coame naturally for me , which makes it incredibly enjoyable.  I decided to include it in my portfolio, because I wanted to showcase the best work that I have done with written arts.  Language Arts is my best class, and I have done a lot of writing in LA, that includes multiple different types of writing.  Enjoy.    </p>
