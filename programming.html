    <h2 id="content_sec-title">Intro</h2>
    <p>I consider myself a very creative person, and one of my favorite ways to express myself  is with coding.  Coding allows me to design user interfaces -- the artistic and human part of technology -- and figure out how to turn them into code.  I also really like to use traditional coding and try to figure out more innovative ways to accomplish something with code.   Here I have selected a couple of examples of code I created that I consider good representatives of what I enjoy doing.</p>

    <h2 id="content_sec-title">Guessing Game</h2>
    <p>
      This project was one of the first things that I did in the programming language Python.  This ended up impressing the Computer Science chair so much, he moved me up one game..  This is the first part, of the game, you think of a number, and the computer outputs “guesses” of what number you are thinking of.  The basic principle of how this works is it guesses the midpoint of the number it last guessed, depending if you tell the computer it is higher or lower.  The secondary part records your final answer, and records that in a database.  Nextime the game is plays, it starts with the midpoint, then depending on the recent answers, it guesses more realistic numbers.  Every time the game is played, the program gets quicker, and better at guessing the number you thought of.

    <h2 id="content_sec-title">PyFile - Project Manager for Beginners</h2>
    <p>
      	After I started to get more proficient in Python, I teamed up with a couple friends, and created a software called PyFile.  This is a project manager, so people can keep track of there files that they program, but it's not like a normal project manager, this ones designed for beginners.  This makes it easy for people who are just learning a language understand how to organize external files and app files the correct way.  It's not hard to use, and it's program adapts to the type of coding your doing, automatically.  It could even be used for a school project outside of coding, or anything really.
